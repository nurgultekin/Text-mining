NLP and data visualizations, including concordance analysis, word clouds, t-SNE projection, and hierarchical clustering techniques, have been employed as integral components of the exploratory 'distant reading' phase within the research methodology for my master's thesis titled 'Bridging the Digital Disparities in Sweden: A Discursive Analysis of Swedish Policy Reports on Digital Inclusion', 2023.

These methods were used for validating and enhancing the primary research framework, which involved discourse analysis of 10 Swedish policy reports covering digital inclusion and digitalization strategies.
