NLP and data visualizations through concordance analysis, word clouds, t-SNE projection, and hierarchical clustering techniques have been employed as part of the exploratory 'distant reading' phase within my research methodology for my master's thesis, titled 'Bridging the Digital Disparities in Sweden: A Discursive Analysis of Swedish Policy Reports on Digital Inclusion, 2023.

These methods were used for validating and enriching the primary research framework discourse analysis of 10 Swedish policy reports covering digital inclusion and digitalization strategies.
